(** Vif is a simple web framework for OCaml 5 based on [httpcats] and Miou. A
    tutorial is available {{:https://robur-coop.github.io/vif/} here} to learn
    how to use it, and another tutorial is available
    {{:https://robur-coop.github.io/miou/} here} to learn how to use Miou.

    {2 Vif as a library and [vif] as a tool}

    Vif is primarily a library that can be used in a project to launch a web
    server. However, the distribution also offers a tool called [vif] that
    allows you to {b natively} interpret an OCaml script in order to launch a
    web server:

    {[
      $ cat >main.ml <<EOF
      #require "vif" ;;

      let default req server () =
        let open Vif.Response.Syntax in
        let field = "content-type" in
        let* () = Vif.Response.add ~field "text/html; charset=utf-8" in
        let* () = Vif.Response.with_string req "Hello World!" in
        Vif.Response.respond `OK
      ;;

      let routes =
        let open Vif.Uri in
        let open Vif.Route in
        [ get (rel /?? nil) --> default ]

      let () =
        Miou_unix.run @@ fun () ->
        Vif.run routes ()
      ;;
      EOF
      $ vif --pid vif.pid main.ml &
      $ hurl http://localhost:8080/ -p b
      Hello World!
      $ kill -SIGINT $(cat vif.pid)
    ]}

    {2 How to launch a Vif server?}

    The first entry point in Vif is the {!val:run} function, which launches the
    HTTP server. This function requires several arguments, the purpose of whose
    is described for the various modules that allow these arguments to be
    specified.

    Vif essentially requires a list of {i routes} for processing client
    requests. However, the user can also specify {i middleware} (see
    {!module:Middlewares}), handlers for processing requests if no routes are
    recognised (see {!module:Handler}), a function for managing the WebSocket
    protocol (see {!section:websocket}), and devices that can manage other
    protocols (such as SQL) (see {!module:Device}).

    {2 Performances & Vif}

    Vif is therefore a web server that takes advantage of OCaml 5 and the use of
    domains thanks to Miou. If you are interested in the performance that Vif
    can offer, it is intrinsic to the results obtained with [httpcats]. We
    therefore invite you to find out more about the latter if you are interested
    in these metrics.

    But here are the latest results for [httpcats] using the benchmarking
    framework provided by TechEnpower (on AMD Ryzen 9 7950X 16-Core Processor):

    {t
      | clients | threads | latencyAvg | latencyMax | latencyStdev | totalRequests |
      |--------:|--------:|:-----------|:-----------|:-------------|:--------------|
      |      16 |      16 | 47.43us    | 2.27ms     | 38.48us      | 5303700       |

    }

    The benchmark can be reproduced using
    {{:https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks} this project}.

    There is a comparison between [httpcats] (used by Vif) using the Miou
    scheduler and Eio. For more information on this, we invite you once again to
    take a look into the [httpcats] project, which goes into detail about the
    differences between Eio and Miou.

    {2 Typed-way to make a web application}

    Vif was developed in line with the ideals of OCaml and aims to provide a
    {i typed API} for a whole range of information considered essential for web
    development. In particular, Vif offers:
    - conversion of user-submitted forms into OCaml values (such as records),
      thanks to [multipart_form]
    - transformation of JSON content into OCaml values, thanks to [jsont]
    - the ability to make {i typed} SQL queries whose results can also be
      transformed into OCaml values, thanks to [caqti] (and [caqti.template])
    - and the ability to {i type} routes, thanks to [furl]

    {2 A full OCaml implementation of a web server}

    Finally, Vif was developed as part of our cooperative
    {{:https://robur.coop} robur}, which is reimplementing a whole series of
    protocols and formats in OCaml. In this case, apart from the fact that we
    use the TCP/IP implementation provided by your system (although we are also
    developing our own, see [utcp]), everything required for Vif is strictly
    implemented in OCaml:
    - cryptographic primitives are provided by [mirage-crypto]
    - hash algorithms are provided by [digestif]
    - checksum algorithms are provided by [checkseum]
    - the TLS protocol implementation is provided by [ocaml-tls]
    - [ocaml-dns] can be used for domain name resolution
    - the {i happy-eyeballs} algorithm can be used to connect to a service which
      OCaml implementation is provided by the [happy-eyeballs] library
    - The HTTP/1.1 protocol is implemented by [ocaml-h1]
    - The H2 protocol is implemented by [h2]
    - Websockets are implemented by [ocaml-h1] (see [H1.Websocket])
    - compression ([zlib] and [gzip]) is handled by [decompress]
    - file MIME type recognition (required for [Content-Type]) is implemented by
      [conan]

    Here is an overview of Vif, its dependencies, and what this library has to
    offer for developing a web application with OCaml 5. *)

module Uri : sig
  (** The [Uri] module provides a small DSL for describing a {i format} that can
      accept values. [Uri] can be considered as the counterpart of the [Format]
      module, but for URIs. That is, you can describe a way to construct a URI
      and apply it to values such as integers or strings.

      {[
        # require "vif" ;;
        # let my_uri =
          let open Vif.Uri in
          host "robur.coop" / "repo" /% string `Path /?? any
        ;;
        val my_uri : (string -> '_w0, '_w0) -> Vif.Uri.t = <abstr>
        # let () =
          print_endline (Vif.Uri.eval my_uri "vif");
          print_endline (Vif.Uri.eval my_uri "hurl")
        ;;
        robur.coop/repo/vif
        robur.coop/repo/hurl
      ]}

      In other words, [Uri] provides a module for {i typing} URIs (and, by
      extension, the routes that can be specified to Vif). *)

  type ('e, 'a) atom = ('e, 'a) Tyre.t
  (** Type of a typed element that makes up the path and/or queries of a URI. *)

  val int : (_, int) atom
  (** [int] is a typed element which recognizes an integer and cast it as OCaml
      [int]. *)

  val string : [ `Path | `Query_value ] -> (_, string) atom
  (** [string where] is a typed element which recognizes a string. This element
      can be located into a {!type:path} (and, in this case, [`Path] must be
      used) or as a {!type:query} parameter of an URI (and, in this case,
      [`Query_value] must be used). *)

  val bool : (_, bool) atom
  (** [bool] is a typed element which recognizes [true] or [false] and cast it
      as an OCaml [bool]. *)

  val float : (_, float) atom
  (** [float] is a typed element which recognize a decimal number and cast it as
      an OCaml [float]. *)

  val rest : (_, string) atom
  (** [rest] is a typed element which recognize anything (including ['/'] and
      ['?']; that is, including {i queries} part of the path). It's useful for
      obtaining (or generating) the end/{i rest} of an URI. *)

  val path : (_, string) atom
  (** [path] is a typed element which recognize anything (including ['/'])
      except the {i queries} part of the path (like [?foo=bar]). It's useful for
      obtaining (or generating) the end of an URI path. *)

  val option : ('e, 'a) atom -> ('e, 'a option) atom
  (** [option t] takes a typed element and make it optional. *)

  val conv : ('a -> 'b) -> ('b -> 'a) -> ('e, 'a) atom -> ('e, 'b) atom
  (** [conv inj prj] creates a new typed element which produces/expects an other
      typed value. [inj] describes how to cast a ['a] value to a ['b] value and
      [prj] describes how to caset a ['b] value to a ['a]. If [inj] raises the
      route is not matched, and the default route is applied instead. It's
      useful to create your own typed element:

      {[
      type fruit = Apple | Orange | Banana

      let fruit =
        let v =
          Tyre.regex Re.(alt [ str "apple"; str "orange"; str "banana" ])

        in
        Vif.Uri.conv inj prj v
      ]} *)

  type ('e, 'f, 'r) path
  (** Type of the path part of an URI. *)

  val rel : ('e, 'r, 'r) path

      relative to any {i host}. *)

  val host : string -> (_, 'r, 'r) path
  (** [host v] is a specific host (like [localhost]) that the URI based on it
      must respect (if the URI is used as route) or generate. *)

  (** [p /% v] operator extends a given path [p] with a new {!type:atom} [v]. *)

  type ('e, 'f, 'r) query
  (** Type of the query part of an URI. *)

  val nil : ('e, 'r, 'r) query
  (** [nil] specifies that the URI has no parameters. If the URI is used to
      specify a route, this means that a request with even one parameter would
      {b not} be recognised with [nil]. If you want to recognise a URI with
      possible parameters, we recommend using {!val:any}. *)

  val any : ('e, 'r, 'r) query
  (** [any] specifies that a URI can have no parameters or multiple parameters.
      It is usually [any] that is preferred to {!val:nil} in the specification

  val ( //? ) : ('e, 'f, 'x) path -> ('e, 'x, 'r) query -> ('e, 'f, 'r) t
  (** [path //? queries] is an operator which permits to construct an URI where

      the slash is {b optionnal} between the given path [path] and queries. *)

  val keval : ?slash:bool -> (Tyre.evaluable, 'f, 'r) t -> (string -> 'r) -> 'f

      [fn]. *)

  val eval : ?slash:bool -> (Tyre.evaluable, 'f, string) t -> 'f

end

module Multipart_form : sig
  (** Vif proposes a way to describe a form via types in order to decode a
      [multipart/form-data] request and obtain an OCaml record.

      Let's take a form such as:

      {[
        <form>
          <label for="username">Username:</label>
          <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
          <label for="password">Password:</label>
          <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
        </form>
      ]}

      It is possible to describe this server-side form in this way:

      {[
      type credential = { username: string; password: string }

      let form =
        let open Vif.Multipart_form in
        let fn username password = { username; password } in
        record fn |+ field "username" string |+ field "password" string |> sealr
      ]}

      It is then possible to define a POST route to manage such a form:

      {[
        let login req _server _cfg =
          match Vif.Request.of_multipart_form req with
          | Ok { username; password; } -> ...
          | Error _ -> ...

        let routes =
          let open Vif.Uri in

  type ('a, 'b, 'c) orecord
  (** The type for representing open records of type ['a] with a constructor of
      type ['b]. ['c] represents the remaining fields to be described using the

  (** {3:multipart-stream Streaming API of [multipart/form-data] requests.}

      The user may want to manage a request containing a form in the form of a
      stream. This is particularly useful if you want to upload a file (and,
      instead of storing it in memory, directly write the received file to a
      temporary file). *)

  type part
  (** Type of a part from the [multipart/form-data] stream.

      A part can specify several items of information such as:
      - its {!val:name} (from the [name] parameter of the HTML tag)
      - whether this part comes from a user file (with the
        {{!val:filename} name} of the file)
      - the {{!val:mime} MIME type} of the content (according to the client)
      - as well as the {!val:size} of the content *)

  val name : part -> string option
  (** [name part] is the name of the part (from the [name] parameter of the HTML
      tag [<input />]). *)

  val filename : part -> string option
  (** [filename part] is the client's filename of the uploaded file. *)

  val mime : part -> string option
  (** [mime part] is the MIME type according to the client's webbrowser. *)

  val size : part -> int option
  (** [size part] is the size of the part in bytes. *)

  type stream = (part * string Flux.source) Flux.stream
  (** Type of a [multipart/form-data] stream.

      It may be necessary to save part of a form as a file rather than storing
      it in memory. Vif allows this using its form stream API. The user can
      observe the parts of a form one after the other and manipulate the content
      of these parts in the form of a stream:

      {[
      open Vif

      let upload req server _ =
        let fn (part, src) =
          match Multipart_form.name part with
          | Some "file" -> S.Stream.to_file "foo.txt" (S.Stream.from src)
          | Some "name" ->
              let value = S.(Stream.into Sink.string (Stream.from src)) in
              Hashtbl.add form "name" value
          | _ -> S.Stream.(drain (from src))
        in
        let stream = Result.get_ok (Request.of_multipart_form req) in
        S.Stream.each fn stream;

module Device : sig
  (** {3 Devices.}

      A {i device} is a global instance that Vif initialises at the same time as
      the HTTP server. The purpose of a {i device} is to access another global
      {i resource} that is not related to HTTP things but is necessary to
      implement certain logic within your request handlers.

      An example of devices is a {i connection pool} to a SQL server to enable
      our request handlers to communicate with it. Instead of initiating a
      connection to the database for each request within our request handlers,
      it is possible to initialise a connection pool when the Vif server is
      launched, which can then be used by our request handlers {b in parallel}.
      It is therefore a {b global} resource that can be retrieved within request
      handlers using {!val:Server.get}. Here is an example of a [caqti]
      {i device} (used to communicate with an SQL server):

module Response : sig
  (** {3 Response.}

      A response is a construction ({i monad}) whose initial state is

      construction, the user can {!val:add}/{!val:rem}/{!val:set} information in
      the {i headers}. Finally, the user must respond with content (via
      {!val:with_string}/{!val:with_stream}) and a status code.

      The interest behind this monad with preconditions and postconditions is to
      enforce the developer to respond only once to the client. This monad also
      enforces that the developer {b must} respond—in fact, the only way to not
      respond in a request handler is to raise an exception. *)

  type filled
